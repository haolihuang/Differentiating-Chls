# Differentiating-Chls
## About the project
---
We tried to differentiate two similar molecules (chlorophyll a & chlorophyll f) using their spectroscopic data. We used two methods; one is to use the Gaussian mixture model to cluster the data, whereas the other is to identify large peak values compared to the baseline level. Detailed introductions and explanations can be found in the Jupyter notebook, along with the code and figures. Because the data are yet to be published, here I only uploaded the `html` version of the notebook. Other data will be uploaded when the manuscript is published.

## Getting started

I used Jupyter notebook for this project. The `html` file can be opened using any web browser.
